# Personal website

This project is where I learned the fundamentals of several technologies:

#### BACKEND
* ASP NET CORE backend API service backed by a PostgreSQL database
* Learned the basics of JWT token based A&A
* Separated the development environment from the production one using Environment variables
* AWS EC2 instances
  * I learned how to create an instance, retrieve its .pem file and connect to the instance through ssh tunneling
* Github actions
  * Action to push the static website contents to the EC2 instance by using SSM (System Manager) with S3 bucket
